Request for Additional Data from INSERT STUDY NAME HERE for Rapid Review on monoclonal antibody treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease

Dear Dr. INSERT NAME HERE

My name is Onyeka Obuaya, and I am a 3rd year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh conducting a rapid review of completed Phase III monoclonal antibody trials for prodromal Alzheimer’s disease/mild cognitive impairment. The aim of my review is to gather aggregated data to quantify the relationship between biomarker changes and related patient outcomes (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) to inform a subsequent simulation study of a potential “multisite” antibody therapy.

I have carefully examined your publication, INSERT STUDY HERE along with any trial registry entries and open-label extension or post-hoc reports. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate certain numerical data needed for my analysis. 

Below is a concise list of the missing values foR your study that would be most helpful to have:

If any of these values were reported in supplementary tables, conference abstracts, or open-label extension papers that I may have overlooked, my apologies. A reference or PDF would also be immensely helpful.

Providing these precise numerical values will allow me to include your study accurately in the meta-analysis portion of my rapid review and ensure that my downstream simulation model correctly represents the biomarker–outcome relationships. In recognition of your time, I would be grateful for any subset of the above data you can share. Additionally, any publications arising from this work will acknowledge your input. 

Please feel free to send the aggregate data directly in reply to this email or as a brief spreadsheet attachment. If there are any licensing considerations or data-sharing forms required by your institution or sponsor, kindly let me know how best to proceed.

Thank you very much for your assistance. I have attached my review protocol for your viewing pleasure.  I aim to finalise my data extraction by the 1st July 2025, so I appreciate any information you can provide before then.
